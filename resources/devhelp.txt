Are you looking to develop with ConsoleC?

--------Section 1: Links--------
I'm basically programming my own scripting language at this point 😭


--------Section 2: Custom Commands--------
To create custom commands, you should create one or multiple files with functions inside.
Each function should be named cmd_[your command name] (for example, cmd_test for a test command).
It should take two parameters: console and args.
The console parameter is the console instance that called the command, and args is an array of the arguments given.
To give output, each function should run the console.output(message: str, color: str) function.
The message is outputted by the console in the color given.
The standard currently used is red for error, green for success, and blue for information/specific output.
Also, please leave in a docstring for each module and function!
For functions, format it like "description\nFormat: command [args]", and for modules, just keep in mind
that the first line will appear in the help command as the module description.
Error handling is done with console.log(message). This is helpful, I strongly recommend doing it.

Good luck!
